# HiFiVarC: A Nextflow Pipeline for TGS variant calling  

> WORK IN PROGRESS  

This is a customizable nextflow pipeline for variant calling of TGS (PacBio/Oxford NanoPore) data with the focus on bacteria.  
This project builds on top of the 2021 School of Molecular and Theoretical Biology project:  [Unveiling mutants in experimental evolution](https://storage.googleapis.com/smtb-production.appspot.com/documents/smtb-2021/lab-10-pipeline-for-long-read-assembly-and-mutation-identification/.PR12_unveiling_mutants_poster.pdf).  
Repository of the original project: [CobaltSeq](https://github.com/catalin-rusnac/CobaltSeq) by Catalin Rusnac and others.   
This workflow supports the growing [replifactory](https://new.replifactory.com/) codebase.  
Replifactory provides cutting-edge automated solutions for experimental evolution. It is a 3D-printed morbidostat/turbidostat lab device with fully open-source software.  

Replifactory is built on collaboration, and we are deeply grateful for the invaluable support from our contributors.
